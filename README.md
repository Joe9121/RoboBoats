# RoboBoat

Welcome to the RoboBoat repository! This repository contains the code and documentation for our RoboBoat project, a competition where boats battle each other in a swimming pool. Our goal was to design and build a formidable robotic boat capable of outmaneuvering and eliminating opponents.

## Hardware Components

To construct our RoboBoat, we utilized the following hardware components:

- Arduino Mega: We used the Arduino Mega microcontroller as the brain of our system, responsible for controlling and coordinating various subsystems.

- Brushless Motors: Two powerful brushless motors were employed to provide propulsion for the boat. These motors were connected to Electronic Speed Controllers (ESCs) to regulate their speed.

- Batteries: We utilized batteries to power the entire system, including the Arduino Mega, motors, and other electronic components.

- Servo Motors: Two servo motors were employed to control the release of arrows from the crossbows. These servo motors allowed us to aim and fire accurately at the opponent boats.

- Bluetooth Module: A Bluetooth module was integrated to enable wireless communication between the boat and external devices, such as a remote control or a companion mobile application.

- 6-Channel Relay: The relay served as a control mechanism for the two airbags. By toggling the relay, we could activate the airbags, causing opponent boats to flip upside down and be eliminated from the competition.

## Weapons

Our RoboBoat was equipped with two primary weapons:

1. Crossbows: We implemented two crossbows, mounted on the boat, to attack other boats. These crossbows were controlled by servo motors, allowing us to aim and fire arrows with precision.

2. Airbags: To gain a strategic advantage, we incorporated two airbags into our boat. These airbags were connected to the 6-channel relay, enabling us to deploy them and flip opposing boats upside down, thereby eliminating them from the competition.

## Repository Structure

The repository is structured as follows:
